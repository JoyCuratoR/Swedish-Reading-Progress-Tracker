<h2>Key features of this language learning reading comprehension progress tracker app:</h2>

- WPM
- Date
- Complexity Level (A1, 2, B1, 2, C1, 2, etc.)
- Word Recognition percentage
- Context Inference percentage

<h2>What is this app calculating?</h2>

My initial idea for a Statistical Formula for 1% Daily Improvement:

The compound growth formula would be...

P(t) = P₀(1 + r)^t

Where:

P(t) = Reading performance at time t
P₀ = Initial reading performance (baseline)
r = Growth rate (0.01 or 1%)
t = Time in days

For example, if you start at 100 words per minute (WPM):

Day 1: 100 × (1.01)¹ = 101 WPM
Day 2: 100 × (1.01)² = 102.01 WPM
Day 30: 100 × (1.01)³⁰ = 134.78 WPM


Establish a baseline (P₀) by measuring your current reading speed in WPM for Swedish texts of similar difficulty
Record your actual daily WPM
Compare your actual progress against the expected compound growth curve

For visualization:

Create a line graph with...

X-axis: Days
Y-axis: Reading speed (WPM)
Two lines: Expected progress (using the formula) and actual measurements
Weekly markers to track longer-term progress

<h2>For Text Complexity (CEFR Levels) modify the formula to include a complexity factor (c):</h2>

P(t,c) = P₀(1 + r)^t × c
Where:

c = complexity multiplier (example values):

A1 = 1.0 (baseline)
A2 = 0.85
B1 = 0.7
B2 = 0.55
C1 = 0.4
C2 = 0.25


For Reading Accuracy:

We need a separate comprehension score (CS) that combines...

Word Recognition Accuracy (WA): % of words correctly understood
Context Inference Accuracy (CIA): % of meaning correctly inferred
Total Comprehension Score = (WA × 0.7) + (CIA × 0.3)

<b>The final formula becomes...</b>

```Total Reading Proficiency = P(t,c) × CS```


Example calculation:

If you're reading B1 text at 100 WPM with...

Word recognition: 80%
Context inference: 90%
CS = (0.8 × 0.7) + (0.9 × 0.3) = 0.83
Final score = 100(1.01)^t × 0.7 × 0.83

This gives you a more realistic measurement that accounts for:

- Speed improvement over time
- Text difficulty
- Word recognition
- Contextual understanding

<h2>Let me explain how to calculate reading comprehension rate. Here's a practical approach:</h2>

1. Basic Reading Speed (Words Per Minute):
```
WPM = (Total words read) ÷ (Time in minutes)
```

2. For comprehension, after reading, you can:
- Write a summary of what you read
- Answer self-created questions about the main points
- Explain the content to someone else
- Identify key concepts and arguments

3. To measure comprehension, create 5-10 questions covering the main points of the text. Calculate:
```
Comprehension % = (Questions answered correctly) ÷ (Total questions) × 100
```

4. Combine these for an effective reading rate:
```
Effective Reading Rate = WPM × (Comprehension % ÷ 100)
```

For example, if you read 300 WPM and got 80% on your comprehension questions, your effective reading rate would be:
300 × (80 ÷ 100) = 240 effective words per minute

For context, many language learners at early stages might read at 40-50 words per minute (wpm) or even slower.
